**WORLD MAP**\
A map that saves a user specified request and calculates it's distance from the current location

The app displays user's current location on start after accepting location permission. A search bar then takes user's request to locate a particular 
place on the map. The app at this point prompts the user to save the location data in a local database with a title and the camera moves to the 
selected location. The saved title can be found through the search bar. If the user doesn't want to save the location data, then the camera
will be directed to the new selected location.
